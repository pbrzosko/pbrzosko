Hi, :wave:

my name is **Przemek Brzosko** and I am a **Java** and **Java Script** developer from Poland.
I started my career as a Java developer, but I quickly specialized myself in **UI** development, which is something I like doing the most. 

### Career

You can read or download my CV here: https://pbrzosko.github.io/pbrzosko/

I have started in 2005, working with **Java Swing** app. I wrote my first UI feature of a progress indicator. It was implemented as a custom event queue
class, which painted an animation in the window if some event took to long to handle. Then I switched towards web applications written in
**Java Server Faces**. I quickly gained experience in the framework as well as web technologies like **HTML, CSS** and **JavaScript**.

Later I continued my JSF journey, when I became an **Area Expert** of the **UI** part of a software house's financial product, which first line of code
was written in late 80's. My responsibilities was to  define the roadmap of the UI, do all code reviews related to and help others working within UI area.

When Java Script revolution came in, I had improved a lot my **Java Script** knowledge and started to take a look at **SPA** frameworks. I fell in love
with **VueJS**, and started doing some projects at home. Later I had abandon JSF libray, and become working as a one man frontend development team
for the whole credit advisory department. All applications were written in VueJS. But besides that I also contributed in Java backend
projects based on **Java, Spring** and **Camunda**.

Somewhere in between, I was able to contribute in projects written in **C, C++** or **C#**.

### Characteristics

If you consider hiring me as a developer, here are my features:

- Throughout my whole career, I have never ever rejected a task to be done. I have always accomplished what I was asked for.
- Everyone always praised me as a someone that it is nice to work with. It is simply because I tend not to be in conflict with others. I'd rather
try to solve problems, not create new ones.
- I am also able to work efficiently without supervision, because I always try to organize my work efficiently and focus on the task.
- My father always told me _"do something good, or do not do it at all"_. I commit to this motto all the time. Of course, in software development there
are budgets and timelines, so I always try to select a solution that is the best from technical aspect, but it also fits into project limitations.
- I don't like wasting time on nothing: meetings - keep it short and concise, solutions - make a Proof Of Concept and evaluate it instead of hours of divagations.

### Collaboration

I would love to work on Single Page Application project. Preferably in VueJS, but React or Angular is also fine.

### Interests

Besides work, I am a big fan of tennis and motorsports, especially Formula 1.

### Repository content

In my repositories you can find some projects, that I have done to show my skills. Please consider though, that those projects are done off
work time, and thus are missing some valid things, like tests:exclamation: (this is the most important part of every software, but if there are 
none I simply couldn't fit it in) or for example error handling.
